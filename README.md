# Inventory Manager for Hurricane Survival (MicroPrepper)

This Python application takes some information from the user and returns an inventory management log of exactly how many supplies they'd need to survive the average hurricane, whether they're sheltering in place or evacuating. 

Future:
I'd like to add a separate function that warns the user to evacuate if the hurricane is a Cat4 or Cat5.
